The Internet is broken

This article goes over a flaw in the public operating systems. Since code is written and then duplicated and altered many times, it is highly probable that there are remaining bugs in the code that may not come out for long periods of time. These bugs can lead to weaknesses in the code that can be exploited. 

The article discussed how there are not a lot of systems in place to audit the code checking for bugs and this allows it to be re-distributed many times before a bug is caught. I would think that this could be an opportunity for companies to emerge that offer code audits for large companies that would require less issues than others. I'm not entirely sure the exact ramifications of bugs but this article made it sound like there is a grave risk of negative consequences. 

Code for operating systems started decades ago and was stored in physical tapes that would have to be transported between locations. Now operating systems can be downloaded anywhere and are used in every computer. The root cause of there being many possible bugs is that the code has been added to since the very beginning of writing the first scripts. Scripts are copied and distributed over and over again until the end user creates the program that they intend to use. These bugs lie deep in the backbone of the origins of code and are exploited by hackers to gain access into the structure of the program.
